# Unity Scripts Collection

A small collection of ready-made Unity C# scripts for small projects and prototypes.  
This repository is a toolbox of reusable scripts you can copy and use anywhere.

## Conent

- **All scripts** → [`Assets/Scripts`](Assets/Scripts)
- **UI scripts** → [`Assets/Scripts/UI`](Assets/Scripts/UI)
- **ToolTips (UI)** → [`Assets/Scripts/UI/ToolTips`](Assets/Scripts/UI/ToolTipS)

## Notes

- Scripts are organized by categories inside `Assets/Scripts`.
- You can copy any folder you need into another Unity project (keep `.meta` files when copying).
